An Introduction to Objective-C
Software Systems, Final LKM
Samantha Kumarasena and Deborah Hellen

For this project, we completed two tutorials: "Try Objective-C" and "Try iOS" through CodeSchool. 

Try Objective-C: http://tryobjectivec.codeschool.com/
Try iOS: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios

Through these tutorials, we programmed 11 small apps. We have included two of the simpler apps we completed through these tutorials in this folder.
